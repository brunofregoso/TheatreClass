This problem was taken from Tim Gallagher, the solution was made by me 



The customer class represents an object per each customer that wishes to be seated in the theatre.
Methods include constructers for the information that pertains per customer object such as name in height, we wish to know height to make sure the shortest people
are seated in the front. 




The theater class provides class methods to get information about the current seating of the theatre.
Such methods include isSeatOccupied, which will return true if it is occupied and false if it is empty
getTallestCustomer returns the talles customer
findMostOccupiedRow returns the row with the most seats occupied 



The theater runner file functions as the main file where two theatre objects are created and using methods from the previous 2 classes, information is 
retrived from both theaters.
